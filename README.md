**How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**

I have encorporated different organizational strategies when I develop code now. I ensure that all blocks of code are clearly labeled with comments and describe acatly what the code does. When designed code for this project. I utilized blocks of code that already existed, especially when rendering new shapes to make the objects in the scene. Copying and pasting code when it only nedes to be altered slightly saved me a great deal of time. This can easily be applied to my future work as long as I remember to ocntinue writting in-line comments. Sometimes it is easy to forget when you get into the groove of writing code.

**How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**

I employed the development strategy of save and save often. Its a simple rule that will keep you from losing a lot of progress during development. Keeping your files clean and organized is helpfull too. I learned to stop copy/pasting when creating zipped files for submission. This is a small detail that makes it a lot easier for me to locate old projects or previous code that I want to recycle. Iteration was important during the creation of the camera. being able to loop through and have the program justify the current and future locations of the camera was a steep learning curve for me, but it was a valuable lesson once I understood how the code loops through location justification. Once I undertsood these elements (including those from the first questions) I was able to not only complete this project, but work on it a lot more efficiently.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**

Computational Graphics and Visualizations has shown me how modular a coding langauge can be. I was confident in my knowledge of C++ before I started using OpenGL. OpenGL is a sub-language of C++ and it showed me how modular C++ can be. This course will not be the last time that I tuilize C++, and possibly OpenGL. This course has helped me understand an entirely new functionality of a programming language I thought that I completely understood, so I will be more aware in future courses to be open to the modualrity of every language that I work with. Considering that I want to eventually become a software engineer, maybe in the videogame industry, I have learned a key piece of that goal.
